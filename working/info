tenableio_autoscan2.py has a masking option and uses a .env for the TIO_ACCESS_KEY and TIO_SECRET_KEY and the target_group
there is a sample .env file with the formatting needed
a log file script.log will be created in the same directory
this will allow the script to be updated and pulled down by anyone without messing up the usage, provided they use the .env

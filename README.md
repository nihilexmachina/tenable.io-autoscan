# tenable.io-autoscan.py
Python script to manage Tenable.io assets first agent scan.

### Purpose
The purpose of this script is to automate certain Tenable.io agent-based scanning tasks. A proper admin should make sure that all their assets have been scanned immediately after agent software provisioning.
#### Use case
The script is programmed to do two simple tasks.
##### Add
The first option, will check the Last Scanned status of every asset in your Tenable.io tenant. If it detects a host that has never been scanned, the script will add it to a specific group as configured in the script (for the sake of the example, we will call such group "Unscanned".).
##### Delete
The second option will check the Last Scanned status of every asset, but this time only those that belong to your Unscanned group. If the script detects a host that has already been scanned, it will pull the host out of the \[Unscanned\] group.  
The joy behind this script is that allows Tenable.io administrators to make sure that every new agent provisioned to the console will be scanned. For this automation to happen, the administrators will require to have a concise schedule plan.
##### logging
There is an option of --log that accepts a flag of 'debug,info,warning,error,critical' -it will log to a script.log file in the same folder the script is ran from
#### Schedule example
08:00 Launch script with --add parameter  
09:00 Execute a daily scheduled basic agent scan of the Unscanned group (12h scan window)  
20:00 Launch script with --delete parameter
